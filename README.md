# Rank7SsinglegeneratorSITAs
This data gives the singly generated standard integral table algebras of rank $7S$, valency k=3 to k=12, up to order $250$. 
#AS-N means the program constructed a scheme of order N for this parameter set.  So those are realizable as Association schemes.
#HL-TA-N means it failed the handshaking lemma, so program could not start.So, they are not realizable. 
#m-TA-N means it passed the handshaking lemma but the program gave up trying to construct a scheme, and when it did the total difference heuristic was m. So, inconclusive
